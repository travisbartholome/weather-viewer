# Custom Weather Backgrounds

These were self-drawn using [Method Draw](http://editor.method.ac), which I really like as a basic vector editor.

I'm obviously no vector artist extraordinaire.

## Possible "condition" descriptions

To decide which backgrounds were appropriate, I checked the weather description at a number of locations using a Node script.

You can view the results of that scanning [here](https://plot.ly/~travis.bartholome/40/).

Ultimately, it seems like all of the conditions boil down to "clear, cloudy, rainy, or snowy," so I made those four backgrounds.

The scripts I used for that process are in the data-gathering directory.
